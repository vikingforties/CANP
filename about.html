        <h3>About this form</h3>
        <p>The CANP system is used to notify military aircrew of the area you are planning to take off from.  Additionally, it links through to NATS (National Air Traffic Services) and activates a NOTAM. CANP submissions are processed by an organisation within the RAF called Low Flying Coord (LFC)*, part of the Military Airspace Management Cell (MAMC), which operates from Monday to Friday as that is when military low flying normally takes place.  *previously known as the Low Flying Booking Cell (LFBC)</p>
        <p>Aim to submit your request to LFC by <b><i>8 pm</b></i> the day before, for planned flying Tuesday to Friday.  The CANP service is not generally available for flying on weekends or on public holidays, though notifications received before <b><i>3pm</b></i> on Friday for weekend flying should be processed.  In addition, notifications for flying on Monday need to be received before <b><i>3pm</b></i> on Friday to give the best chance of a NOTAM being published.  Outside of these times you may receive a 'Late Warning' advisory which indicates that the NOTAM may not be published in time. There is currently no other way of raising a NOTAM for routine BHPA activities.</p>
        <p>Historically, there has been a belief that raising a CANP or NOTAM for a site would attract military or General Aviation pilots to come and have a look at what's going on. We can't change this belief except to say that there is absolutely no evidence for it. There is, however, evidence for near misses at sites where a CANP or NOTAM has not been raised.</p>
        <p>Save a link to this form on your desktop or mobile device and the whole thing can be done in less than a minute. Then you can pat yourself on the back for helping to keep you and your fellow fliers safe. <i class="far fa-smile" aria-hidden="true"></i></p>
